Introduction to algorithms
2nd ed.
Preface
This book provides a comprehensive introduction to the modern study of computer 
algorithms. It presents many algorithms and covers them in considerable depth, 
yet makes their design and analysis accessible to all levels of readers. We have
tried to keep explanations elementary without sacrificing depth of coverage or
mathematical rigor.
