8.1 put the 'Goodbye!' in the output buffer; if os is an 'ifstream' object, it will be wrong.

8.2 ostream& print(ostream& os);

8.5 EOF or some error

8.11 actually this may have little difference with the experiment output, when 
     close() a ifstream object, there seems no need to clear() it any more

8.12 if close() failed, open() will failed too, then 'in' is invalid
